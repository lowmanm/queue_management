## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Active Phase** | Phase 4 — Persistence + Production |
| **Phase Status** | **Complete** — All waves done |
| **Last Session** | 2026-03-20 |
| **Next Action** | `/ship 4` — create Phase 4 PR and update ROADMAP.md |

## What Just Happened (Session: 2026-03-19)

### Phase 3 — Logic Builder — SHIPPED ✅

All 22 v1 requirements implemented, verified, and PR opened.

**PR branch:** `claude/dlq-monitor-pipeline-status-Iq03S` → `develop`
**PR URL:** https://github.com/lowmanm/queue_management/pull/new/claude/dlq-monitor-pipeline-status-Iq03S
**Verification:** `.planning/phases/3/VERIFICATION.md` — PASS

### What Was Delivered

| Feature | Routes | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline Creation Wizard | `/admin/pipelines/new` | `designerGuard` |
| Rule Builder UI | `/admin/rule-sets` | `designerGuard` |
| Queue Configuration Panel | Embedded in Pipelines admin | `designerGuard` |
| DLQ Monitor | `/manager/dlq` | `managerGuard` |
| Pipeline Status Dashboard | `/manager/pipeline-status` | `managerGuard` |

**Backend additions:**
- `DlqController` — 5 DLQ endpoints (filter, stats, retry, reroute, discard)
- `PipelineMetricsService` — per-pipeline throughput, SLA %, error rate
- `PipelineVersionService` — config snapshots + rollback (max 20 versions)
- `POST /api/pipelines/:id/validate` — dry-run validation
- `POST /api/rules/sets/:id/test` — rule set before/after trace
- `pipeline:metrics` WebSocket broadcast every 10s

### Decisions Made This Phase

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Form-based rule builder (not visual drag-and-drop) | Faster to build, sufficient for v1. Visual builder is Phase 5+ |
| Pipeline wizard is multi-step | Complex config benefits from guided steps |
| DLQ monitor is Manager/Admin only | Agents/Designers shouldn't manage failed tasks |
| In-memory stores continue for Phase 3 | Persistence is Phase 4 |
| `setInterval` in gateway for metrics broadcast | Avoids `@nestjs/schedule` dependency |
| `@Optional()` injection for version/metrics services | Graceful degradation at construction time |

## Phase 3 — Complete

| Wave | Plan | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Wave 1 | `1-1-backend-extensions-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 2 | `2-1-pipeline-wizard-queue-config-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 2 | `2-2-rule-builder-ui-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 2 | `2-3-dlq-monitor-pipeline-status-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |

---

## Phase 4 — In Progress

**Goal:** Replace in-memory stores with durable persistence, add horizontal scaling, prepare for production.

| Wave | Plan | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Wave 1 | `1-1-debt-clearance-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 2a | `2-1-postgresql-persistence-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 2b | `2-2-redis-event-sourcing-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |
| Wave 3 | `3-1-auth-monitoring-deploy-PLAN.md` | ✅ Complete |

| Deliverable | Description |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL queue backing | `queue_tasks` table with priority index |
| Redis real-time layer | Agent state, session cache, pub/sub for multi-instance |
| Event sourcing | Immutable event log for task lifecycle audit trail |
| Horizontal scaling | Stateless API servers behind load balancer |
| Real authentication | Replace mock auth with OAuth2/OIDC provider |
| Monitoring & alerting | Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards |

## Active Decisions & Context

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `npx nx lint api-server` — correct target is `npx nx run api-server:eslint:lint` | The short `lint` alias does not exist for api-server |
| ~167 pre-existing lint errors in `agent-workspace` | From Phase 2 and earlier; not introduced by Phase 3; address during Phase 4 refactor |
| 10 pre-existing lint errors in `api-server` | In `routing.service.ts` and `tasks.service.ts`; document in Phase 4 scope |

---

## Blockers

None currently.

---

## Project Health

| Metric | Status |
|---|---|
| Build | ✅ Passing |
| Lint | ✅ 0 errors (agent-workspace cleared 119→0 in Phase 4 Wave 3) |
| Tests | ✅ 65 tests passing |
| Tech Debt | agent-workspace **0** ✅; api-server 0 ✅ (both fully cleared) |

## How to Use This File

1. **Returning to project** → Read "Current Position" and "Next Action"
2. **Starting a session** → Run `/status` to get a formatted summary
3. **Ending a session** → Run `/update-state` to capture decisions and progress
4. **Context too stale** → Check ROADMAP.md for phase status, REQUIREMENTS.md for scope

*Last Updated: 2026-03-20 (Phase 4 complete — JWT auth, Prometheus metrics, Docker Compose, accessibility debt cleared 119→0)*
